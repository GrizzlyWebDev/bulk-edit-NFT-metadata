<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A simple Javascript project that I created to easily bulk edit JSON metadata files for NFT projects that I was working on at the time.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

1. DELETE `example.json` in the `input` folder.
2. Place JSON files into the `input` folder.
3. In the `edit.js` file change the object keys on starting on line 20.
4. Run `node edit.js` to run the script.
5. Your edited JSON files will be in the `output` folder.
